# Medieval 2 Total War Mod

## Installation:

	- Copy all the files (but only the english OR the german .exe file, depending on your keyboard layout) 
	  in your Medieval 2 Root folder. 
	- Make a shortcut to launch.bat and place it somewhere
	- Optional: Give that shortcut the Medieval 2 logo
	- Start the game from the shortcut
	- If the mod doesn't start automatically (You can't control the general), close the cmd window and start
	  M2TWBI.exe manually.

## In-Game-Controls:

	- U: forward(fast)
	- U+V: forward(slow)
	- H+K: turning(animations for turning disabled atm)
	- J: backward
	- DEL: switch between general/RTS view (!!generals unit must be highlighted!!)
	- 0: activate/deactivate slowmotion in RTS view
	- MOUSE: move camera

## Important:

	- In this release active fighting is disabled. You also might have to click attack on a unit first before your
 	  general is able to attack.
	- In all other cases you should avoid giving persue orders to your generals unit. It will result in a stop and go
 	  habit of your horse. If something like this happens, just press the HALT button and everything will be normal
 	  again
	- Turning speed of your horse might differ from machine to machine as I haven't implemented a tick counter yet.
 	  This will be fixed soon

## ENJOY THE MOD!
